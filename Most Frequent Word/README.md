# Most Frequent Word
This repository contains a solution to the problem of finding the most frequent word in a string of characters.

## Problem
Given a string `str`, find the most frequent word in it. The function should return the most frequent word as a string. If there are multiple words with the same maximum frequency, they should be concatenated with a space separator.

## Notes
The current implementation of the function assumes that the input string contains only words separated by **spaces**. If the input string contains other characters, such as punctuation marks or numbers, they will be treated as part of the words.
